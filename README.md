# InvadersOfTheSpace
Game made without game engine!

This game made using Java is a project created by Henrique Colombari and Caio Ferraz Marini, in 2019, for the CG subject on UNAERP 
(Universidade de RibeirÃ£o Preto)

The project goal was to make a simple game without using any pre-existing game engine, just simple cg techniques
The chosen game was the classic Space Invaders, we hope you guys like it!!

We used only netbeans graphic interface, somo images and sounds, all the game physics and interactions were made by hand.

Feel free to use anything here as you wish, just pls reference us if you want ðŸ˜ƒ
